# DARK TITANIUM TOOLS

by xNova22x



## About

This mod is all about Dark Titanium, the fancy, powerful brother of regular titanium.

If you're lucky you can find the rare Dark Titanium ore deep down underground.



## How to get started

First, you want to find iron to make a iron pickaxe, cause you need it to dig the dark titanium ore.

Second, you need to find the dark titanium ore, and magnesium ore. And you also need some coal (charcoal won't work!)

If you dig the dark titanium ore, you'll get impure dark titanium that you can smelt to make raw dark titanium. From magnesium ore, you'll get magnesium shards. Four of them can make a magnesium crystal. You'll need at least 2 of them. Then you can start putting 2 raw dark titanium, 2 magnesium crystals and 1 coal into the crafting grid. You'll get dark titanium mass, that you can smelt, and this will get you 2 dark titanium ingots.

To make tools from this you can do the whole process again, but don't smelt the dark titanium mass. Craft the mass together with 4 stone rods (made by 2 stones or 2 cobblestones) and you'll get an unformed dark titanium rod. Now put this thing in the oven and you'll get 4 dark  titanium rods. 

Now you can make dark titanium tools and armor!
